"""
Rules for the game environment(s) and the basic player actions.

All environments are grid-based cellular automata with discrete evolution.
Agents can perform actions within/upon the environments outside of an
evolutionary step. Therefore, an environment is primarily responsible for
three things:

1. maintaining environment state (and saving and loading it);
2. advancing the environment one step;
3. executing agent actions and edits.

    Collection of flags for cellular automata.

    Attributes
    ----------
    alive
        Every cell in the cellular automata system can either be 'alive' or
        'dead'. At each evolutionary step live cells can be converted to dead
        cells and vice versa depending on the presence of neighboring live cells.
    movable
        Marks cells that can be pushed by the agent.
    destructible
        Marks cells that can be destroyed by the agent.
    frozen
        Frozen cells do not change during each evolutionary step.
        They won't become alive if they're dead, and they won't die if they're
        alive.
    freezing
        Freezing cells prevent all neighbors from changing during each
        evolutionary step. Freezing cells are themselves not necessarily frozen.
    spawning
        Spawning cells randomly create new living cells as their neighbors.
    color_(rgb)
        Every cell can have one of three color flags, for a total of 8 possible
        colors. New cells typically take on the color attributes of the cells
        that created them.
    agent
        Special flag to mark the cell as being occupied by an agent.
        Mostly used for rendering, as the actual location of the agent is stored
        separately.
    exit
        Special flag to mark a level's exit. The environment typically stops
        once an agent reaches the exit.
